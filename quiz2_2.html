                There are many kinds of computer networks. A major distinction can be made 
                between terminal-based networks and computer-based networks. Terminal-based 
                networks are characterized by the presence of a centralized computer that 
                communicates with a large number of remote terminals. The terminals can range from 
                general-purpose terminals with keyboard and screen to highly specialized devices.
                They perform two main functions: local data processing tasks and the processing 
                needed to communicate with the central computer. An example of a terminal-based 
                network is found in a large department store where many points-of-sale are linked to 
                a central computer. Terminal-based systems with thousands of terminals can also be 
                found, for example, computer networks used for airline reservations. One of the 
                earliest computer networks was the American Airlines SABRE (Sales and Business 
                Reservations done Electronically) reservation system built in the 1960s. This 
                prototype of all subsequent reservation systems linked over a thousand terminals 
                scattered throughout the United States to a central computer system maintaining all 
                the airline's flight information. <br> <br>
                Computer-based networks, on the other hand, are characterized by the presence of 
                multiple distributed computers with decentralized control. This type of network is used 
                extensively for the transmission of files, including e-mail messages, among users of 
                different computers on the network. Where communication distances less than a few 
                kilometres are involved, for instance, a computer network within a single building or
                university campus, the term local area network (LAN) is used. LANs often employ 
                data-transmission links (electrical or optical cables) that are private to the network in 
                question. For computer networks spread over large geographical areas, sometimes 
                termed wide-area networks (WANs), the data-transmission facilities are typically 
                supplied by communications companies called common-carriers, which in many 
                countries are government-owned or -regulated organizations. The various national 
                and international telephone networks are extensively used for both local and long- 
                distance computer communications, but they are increasingly being supplemented by 
                networks designed specifically for digital data transmission. Like the telephone 
                networks, these public data networks are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of 
                electrical, optical and microwave links.  <br><br>
                Communications costs are major contributors to the total cost of using a wide-area 
                computer network. There are various techniques for sharing the long-distance 
                communication links to reduce these costs. The establishment of a dedicated 
                communication path from source to destination for each information exchange is 
                called circuit or line switching. It is the usual mode of communication used in the 
                public telephone network. Circuit switching is established by dialling and implemented 
                by telephone exchanges. It has the disadvantage that once a path is established 
                between two locations, it cannot be used by other potential users along the path, 
                even if the utilization of that path is very low.<br><br>
                The problem can be overcome by a technique called message switching, whereby 
                intermediate switching centres on a long communication path are used to store data 
                and subsequently forward it to the next destination, a process called store-and- 
                forward. Messages are collected at each switching centre where they are organized in 
                a manner that makes efficient use of the data paths connected to that centre.
                Compared with circuit switching, message switching can provide a substantial 
                increase in communication link utilization.
