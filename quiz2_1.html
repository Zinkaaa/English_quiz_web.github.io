                Because there are many concurrent processes within a computer system, it is 
                necessary to have an executive or master control program; such a program is known 
                as an operating system. The operating system is designed to exercise overall control 
                of the system, scheduling operations, allocating system resources, preventing 
                interference between programs and so on. In multiuser environments the operating
                system is oriented towards timesharing, being responsible for the efficient sharing of 
                such resources as CPU time, memory space, IO devices, utility programs and so on. 
                There are also specialized operating systems for computers that require very short 
                response times (real-time systems) and for wide-area networks (transaction- 
                processing systems). <br> <br>
                The basic unit of computing managed by an operating system is a process or task, a 
                loose definition of which could be a self-contained program module in the course of 
                execution: for instance, a subroutine being executed by a CPU or an IO program being 
                executed by an IO processor might be typical examples of processes. The resources 
                required by a process, such as a processor and memory space, are usually allocated it
                dynamically during execution. <br><br>
                Some processes are created in response to user commands to the operating system, 
                others are created by other processes. While in existence, a process has three major 
                states: ready, running and blocked. In a ready state a process is waiting, perhaps in a 
                queue with other processes, for the resources it needs to enter the running state. A 
                blocked process is waiting for some event to occur, such as completion of some other 
                process that provides it with necessary data. A transition from one state to another is 
                triggered by various conditions such as interrupts and user instructions to the 
                operating system. When no longer needed, a process (but not the underlying 
                program) can be deleted via the operating system so that any resources currently 
                allocated to it are released. <br><br>
                An operating system contains huge amounts of software, as it is made up of a large 
                number of computer resource management programs such as processor scheduling 
                routines, virtual memory routines and IO device control programs. Moreover some 
                commonly used utility programs like programming language translators, text editors
                etc. are often considered part of the operating system and are invoked via commands 
                to it. All of this software is far too much to store in main memory in its entirety. As a 
                result the less frequently used parts of the operating system such as file management 
                routines and compilers reside in secondary memory, and are only brought into main 
                memory when needed. The other portion of the operating system consisting of the
                most frequently used parts remains continuously in main memory and is termed the 
                kernel. <br><br>
                The kernel is responsible for creating, deleting and state-switching the many 
                processes that define the computer's behaviour. It does so by responding to a steady 
                flow of interrupt requests coming from a variety of sources, such as user-generated
                requests for operating system services, memory allocation/deallocation requests, IO 
                operations, etc. It achieves a rapid response by only briefly disabling other interrupts 
                while responding to the current one, then dispatching or creating an operating system 
                process to execute the appropriate interrupt-handling routine. The performance and 
                reliability of the kernel can be improved by implementing some of its more basic
                functions in the hardware or firmware.</p>
