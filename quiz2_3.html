            <h2>Multiprocessor Reading Comprehension</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="reading-para">
            <p id="reading-para">
                A multiprocessor is a computer system characterized by the presence of several CPUs 
                or, more generally, processing elements (PEs), which cooperate on common or shared 
                computational tasks. Multiprocessors are distinguished from multicomputer systems 
                and computer networks, which are systems with multiple PEs operating independently 
                on separate tasks. The various PEs making up a multiprocessor typically share 
                resources such as communication facilities, input-output devices, program libraries, 
                databases etc., and are all controlled by a common operating system.  <br> <br>

                The two main reasons for including multiple PEs in a single computer system are to 
                improve performance and to increase reliability. Performance (i.e. throughput) 
                improvement is obtained either by allowing many PEs to share the computation load 
                associated with a single large task, or by allowing many smaller tasks to be performed 
                in parallel in separate PEs. A multiprocessor composed of n identical processors is an 
                example of a n-unit processor that can, in principle, provide n times the performance 
                of a comparable single-unit system or uniprocessor. A major goal in designing n- 
                processor systems is to obtain a speedup S(n) that is as near to n as possible. System 
                reliability is improved by the fact that failure of one CPU need not cause the entire 
                system to fail. The functions of the faulty processor and its local resources can be 
                taken over by the other processors; consequently multiprocessors allow fault- 
                tolerance to be incorporated into the system. Of particular interest is the ability of 
                fault-tolerant multiprocessors to operate correctly at a reduced or degraded 
                performance level in the presence of hardware or software failures, a property called 
                graceful degradation. By enabling such facilities as secondary memory units and 
                system software to be shared efficiently, a multiprocessor architecture can lead to 
                significant reduction in overall system cost. <br><br>

                Multiprocessors can be classified by the organization of their main-memory systems. 
                If main memory, or a major portion of main memory, can be directly accessed by all 
                the PEs of a multiprocessor, the system is termed a shared-memory computer, and 
                the shared portion of main memory is called global memory. Information can 
                therefore be shared among the processors simply by placing it in the global memory. 
                Distributed-memory computers, on the other hand, have no global memory. Instead 
                each processing element has its own private or local main memory. Distributed 
                memory systems share information by transmitting it in the form of messages 
                between the local memories of different processors; such message passing requires a 
                series of relatively slow input-output operations. Shared-memory and distributed- 
                memory multiprocessors are also called tightly coupled and loosely coupled, 
                respectively, reflecting the speed and ease with which they can operate on common 
                tasks.</p>
